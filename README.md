CleanData_Project
=================

You will need to download the data file from the following URl into your R working directory
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Unzip the file in this location and it should create a sub directory called **UCI HAR Dataset** in which the data files will exist.
You can also get further information on the data by reviewing the following files within **UCI HAR Dataset**
* README.txt
* feature_info.txt

You will also require the following library to be installed **dplyr** which can be installed by excuting the following **install.packages("dplyr") at the R command line.

Copy the run_analysis.R script to your working directory. You should now be able to execute the script.
The Tidy data result file will be created at the end of the script and should be available in the **UCI HAR Dataset** directory.
The file will be called **TidyFile.txt**

Good Luck!!
